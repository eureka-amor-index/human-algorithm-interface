# Human–Algorithm Interface

A research repository exploring the interface between human behavior
and algorithmic systems.

Not as products.  
Not as platforms.  
As interpretive systems.

## Scope

This repository focuses on:
- How algorithms perceive, classify, and act on information
- How humans adapt, signal, and behave within algorithmic environments
- The interface layer where infrastructure becomes experience

## Orientation

The interface is not a screen.  
It is a behavioral contract.

Interpretation is a functional layer.

## Status

Active research repository.  
Notes, models, and observations will evolve over time.
