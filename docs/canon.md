# \# Canon



This document defines the canonical interpretation of

Eureka Amor and the Human–Algorithm Interface.



It exists to reduce ambiguity.



---



\## Canonical Position



Eureka Amor operates at the intersection of

human behavior, algorithmic systems,

and information interpretation.



This work is not metaphorical by default.

Metaphor is used only as an interface,

not as a substitute for infrastructure.



---



\## What This Is



\- A research-driven body of work

\- A system-level approach to search, AI, and information

\- An exploration of how meaning is produced and interpreted

\- A living archive of observations and models



---



\## What This Is Not



\- Not a personal blog

\- Not a marketing framework

\- Not a content strategy service

\- Not an abstract art project



---



\## On Language



Language is treated as infrastructure.



Words are signals.

Narratives shape system behavior.

Clarity reduces interpretive drift.



---



\## On Visibility



Visibility is a side effect, not a goal.



The primary objective is

correct interpretation

by both humans and algorithmic systems.



---



\## Canon Stability



This canon may evolve,

but changes must preserve

the core interpretive position.



Ambiguity is allowed.

Confusion is not.
